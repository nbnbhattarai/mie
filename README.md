MIE is an application that provides a container to store your data and app (MI app/plugins) to share information online.

One can install the MIE app (which is a simple program files in a directory) that is responsible for data handling and client communication.

For example: having a social app on your MIE can help you have your social data on your server and third party application can be used to access social media shared through MIE. Data is protected with various privacy rules and data encryption.

## Usage:  
- A community can use a shared machine to host MIE server and storage which gives them total control over their data. With encryption, MIE data are secure in any server though having a personal server provides additional security and control.
-  With encryption, even if the data are duplicated one won't be able to get the actual data due to various encryption levels.
- It provides an opportunity to create open-source clients to access and use various apps like social MIE.
